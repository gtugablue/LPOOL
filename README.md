# LPOOL
Multiplayer and multi-device pool game, developed as a project for the "Object Oriented Programming Laboratory" course.

The game consists of a host desktop application and a client Android app (both designed in Java). The Android app acts as a remote controller for the game, so the 2 players would tilt their phones to change the direction of the hit and several buttons and controls to hit the ball with different intensities and spin rotations. The desktop application used LibGDX to produce 3D graphics of the game and act as a physics engine.
